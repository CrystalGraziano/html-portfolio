<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, I am Crystal, single mother of two incredible young people.  Partner. Eternal student. Book worm. </p>

<p> When I was in my late twenties, I was working on my AS in Software Development and Cyber Security, until Covid happened. Then I changed direction to a health degree and earned my BS in Biobehavioral Health from Penn State University.</p>

<p>My goal is to become a front end web developer for work until I can gain more knowledge in a laboratory setting to be eligible to attend medical school where I will use the knowledge gleaned to better healthcare for patients.</p>
